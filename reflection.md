Lab 3 OAuth Integration

1. CSRF and the state Parameter: In your own words, explain how an attacker could perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack on an OAuth flow. How does using the state parameter, as recommended, prevent this specific attack?
- CSRF happens when there's an attack against the OAuth causing a different browers to potentially consume the victim's Authorization code without them knowing. The state parameter prevents this from happening by maintaining state between the request and callback and redirecting user-agent back to client.

2. Redirect URI Attacks: The article mentions that validating a redirect_uri by simply checking the domain or allowing subdomains is a common mistake. Describe a hypothetical scenario where a “leaky” redirect_uri validation (e.g., one that allows any path on a valid domain) could be exploited to steal an authorization code.

3. User Experience vs. Security: Adding a third-party login option like “Login with Google” is a significant user experience improvement. However, it also introduces complexity and new potential security risks. Based on the article and your own thoughts, describe one key trade-off a development team must consider when deciding to implement OAuth. (For example, think about the balance between convenience for the user and the responsibility of the application to protect user data).
